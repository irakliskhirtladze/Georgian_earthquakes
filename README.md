# Georgian_earthquakes

1. I scraped the earthquake records from Georgia's National Seismic Monitoring Centre website (https://ies.iliauni.edu.ge/?lang=en) and database contains data since 07.14.2021.
2. This data includes only relatively strong (mostly 2+ magnitude) earthquakes recorded in Georgia
3. The recorded earthquake's epicenter may or may not be located on Georgian territory
4. Each run of scraper will add new records (if there are any) to a local database
