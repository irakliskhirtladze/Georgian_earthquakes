# Georgian_earthquakes
The records are scraped from Georgia's National Seismic Monitoring Centre website (ies.iliauni.edu.ge) and contain data since 07.14.2021. This dataset contains only relatively strong (mostly 2+ magnitude) earthquakes recorded in Georgia, however this does not mean that all earthquakes' epicenters were in Georgia.
